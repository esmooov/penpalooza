                  What is Penpalooza?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Penpalooza is a penpal exchange started by New York City-based writer Rachel Syme in the spring of 2020 as a way to combat isolation during what we thought might be a short period of lockdown (lol, nope) during the pandemic. Since launching, the program now has over 7000 participants from over 50 countries sending letters to each other all around the globe.

                <h3>
                    Why is the sign-up on Elfster? Isn’t that a Secret Santa website?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    As it turns out, there are no easy algorithms already set up for matching pen pals! So we turned to Elfster, a software that facilitates Secret Santas and gift exchanges, to pair people. Now, Penpalooza is one of largest groups the site has ever had! One fun aspect of using Elfster is that you technically get two matches -- someone you are writing to first, and someone who writes you first, so there is no waiting to send your first letter. Your address is private on the site and only available to view by the person assigned to write to you.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    I see on the Elfster site, the exchange is for people over 18. I am younger than that. Can I still participate?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    If you are under 18, or you have a child who would like to participate, please email us at <a href="mailto:hellopenpalooza@gmail.com">hellopenpalooza@gmail.com</a>. We will try to locate a match in a similar age group!
                </p>

                <h3>
                    I signed up on Elfster but never got a match. What do I do?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    After signing up, you should receive an email from Elfster within three days telling you that you have a match (a note: it will say you have a “gift” to send, but here, gift means letter!). If you do not get this email, check your spam! If you still don’t see it, please email us at <a href="mailto:hellopenpalooza@gmail.com">hellopenpalooza@gmail.com</a>.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    I wrote my penpal, but it has been a long time and I have not heard back. What do I do?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Email us! We can reach out to your penpal and see what the delay might be. Or we can get you a new match.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    I have been ghosted by all my penpals and want to try again. How do I do that?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Email us with your FULL NAME and ADDRESS and we can get you a new match.
                </p>

                <h3>
                    My penpals are working out great, but I want MORE! Can I get additional matches?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    You sure can. Please email us with your FULL NAME and ADDRESS and the number of extra matches you want. Please specify domestic or international, or a mix of both!
                </p>

                <h3>
                    I got a match but I don’t know what to write in my first letter. Help!
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Start simple! A short postcard saying hello (with your return address, of course) is a great first step. Or you can write a little bit about yourself: what you see out of your window in the morning, what your daily routine is like, what prompted you to want to join a penpal program in the first place. A letter in the mail, no matter how short, is always better than no letter at all!
                </p>

                <h3>
                    Do you have any tips for making my letters feel a bit more special?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The members of Penpalooza have gotten really creative with this, and you can too! Think about including little extras: tea bags, stickers, leaves from your yard, pressed flowers, bookmarks, vintage postcards, polaroids of your pets, a poem, etc. If you want even more inspiration, you can follow along with the #penpalooza tag on Twitter, or subscribe to our bi-monthly newsletter, where members of the Penpalooza community will share tips and tricks on gussying up your correspondence!
